                        The forecasted data can be used to infer upcoming mobility trends within counties, which we have
                        found generally correlated with retail sales for certain industries. Forecasted relative
                        mobility is predicted at the county level based on its time series driving data. Trained on the
                        DeepAR algorithm with a day frequency rate, the prediction model reflects increases in mobility
                        affected by weekends, seasonality, and responses to the changing COVID restrictions

                        Three prediction quantiles - p[0.1], p[0.5], p[0.9] - are displayed to indicate the level of
                        uncertainty in each forecast. To determine which to use, consider the costs of
                        under/over-estimation (e.g. for the p[0.1] prediction, the true value is expected to be the
                        lower than the predicted value 10% of the time)

                        Results have an average 4% error in either direction. Future improvements include addition of
                        associated COVID time series data and county metadata (economic, demographic).
